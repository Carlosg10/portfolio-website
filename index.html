                <p>My aspiration after becoming a paid developer run far. After getting paid for my code I would like to learn on for about 5 more years
                    and than start working for myself. I will expand my brand by using resources like Youtube and Twitter. Funding my startup and owning a 
                    successful one for me is a lifetime goal. I would love to teach grade school kids how to code because I believe learning this skill at 
                    an early age is really benefiting. I would also like to develop an app people can use on their phone to make their nyc public parking 
                    experience convenient and free of expense of private parking lot fees.
