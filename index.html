      <p class="text1">My aspiration after becoming a paid developer run far. After getting paid for my code I would like to learn on for about 5 more years
        and than start working for myself. I will expand my brand by using resources like Youtube and Twitter. Funding my startup and owning a
        successful one for me is a lifetime goal. I would love to teach grade school kids how to code because I believe learning this skill at
        an early age is really benefiting. I would also like to develop an app people can use on their phone to make their nyc public parking
        experience convenient and free of expense of private parking lot fees.
